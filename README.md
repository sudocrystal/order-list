# order-list

Given a singly linked list whose nodes contain only the values 0, 1, or 2, write a method called `orderList` that sorts the list.

e.g. If there is a `list` that contains the values `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 0` and we call `orderList(list)`, then the result should be `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2`.
